"It is only once you give up on absolute truth and certainty that you can make progress".  The more I learn the more I don't know. There are exceptions to just about every rule in the book.  Yet progress is necessary.  Data is the best, and fastest way I know to increase progress.  It is hard to know where to go if you forget where you have been.  To me, data is fascinating, because it gives us a way to build maps in any domain.  The more complete the map becomes, the better direction you have.

My projects are based on domains that I am interested in.  I am constantly seeking answers to questions that are interesting to me.  Check them out!

Thanks for being here :)
