"It is only once you give up on absolute truth and certainty that you can make progress". There are millions of opinions and ideas out there in the world.  It is hard to determine what you should listen to. It is hard to determine what the best route is.  I love data science because it allows for implementation of new information to build and improve models of the world we live in.  

My representations will show, to my best ability, projects based on data and ideas that I am interested in.  There will be mistakes, there will be unknown biases, and as always, there will be better ways to show what I present.  I simply ask that you let me know about them and join me on my journey towards Truth! 

Thanks for being here :)
