Seeking the truth is hard.  There are millions of opinions and ideas out there in the world.  It is hard to determine what you should listen to or what is being heavily influenced by biases.  I love data science because it helps filter out baseless ideas.  My goal is to seek truths with data! 

My representations will show, to my best ability, facts from data and ideas that I am interested in.  There will be mistakes, there will be unknown biases, and as always, there will be better ways to show what I present.  I simply ask that you let me know about them and join me on my journey to Truth! 

Thanks for being here :)
