<a href="https://medium.com/p/4a2805ef4d64/edit">"How lucky of you to be left handed!". A constant message to me while growing up playing tennis. Was I lucky? Didn't really feel like it when I was playing. Winning a tennis match was always hard for me. If it is such an advantage, lefties should be dominating the top of the game, right? This is my attempt to find out.</a>
