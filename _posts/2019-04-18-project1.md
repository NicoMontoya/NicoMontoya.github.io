How lucky of you to be left handed!". A constant message to me while growing up playing tennis. Was I lucky? Didn't really feel like it when I was playing. Winning a tennis match was always hard for me. If it is such an advantage, lefties should be dominating the top of the game, right? This is my attempt to find out.

Notable left handers are easy to point out. Nadal, McEnroe, Laver on the mens side. Kerber, Navratilova, Seles on the women's side. As a whole though, it is not so clear that they have an advantage due to the hand that they play with. A quick glance at the rankings don't say much either. Only one on the men's side currently resides in the top 10, Nadal. On the women's side, it is a little more convincing initially, with 3 lefties sitting in the top 10 (Kerber, Kvitova, Pliskova).Â 

In this study I will look at the top 100 men and women over the past 9 years as well as the matches that they played against each other. Primarily comparing their results based on the hand they primarily play with. I will briefly analyze if surface has any effect on the results as well.
