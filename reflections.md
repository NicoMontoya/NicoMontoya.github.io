These writings are for me.  After listening to a lot of advice, reading many books, and observing many idols, I can only conclude that my thoughts pertain best to me.

## Figuring it Out (started on 12-13-2020)

  I recently got asked "so Nico, what is your outlook on life today?"  My answer was pretty incoherent, and I could tell that I lost the attention of the person who asked me in about 5 seconds.  With more time to think about it, I realize that I am Confused.  One, I haven't really thought deeply about that question. Two, it's a pretty broad question. The fact that I tried to answer it right away like I had any idea of what I was saying is kind of silly looking back.
  
  After I realized that I was confused about my outlook on life, the obvious question to me was "why?" Why was I so confused. I've lived more life today than I have ever before this point.. I am "educated", I've lived in multiple places around the world, I have formed a series of different relationships with people that inhabit this world.. what am I so confused about?  
  
  One possibility is: I have had a rather fortunate life.  First, I have hit what some people like to call the "Ovarian Lottery".  I have had not just biological parents.. but multiple figures in my life from the start that love, care and pushed me to be the best person I can be.  If that was not enough, I have gained even more figures in my life as I have grown, that have helped mentor and nurture me to be in a place of highest potential in life.  Through these relationships that I've had by default.. the trajectory of my life was already in a good spot.  I could dive deeper into this, and sure, I'd like to give myself some credit maybe, but the reality is I was put on a rocket, and it has led me to good things thus far. 
  
  It's hard to say if this trajectory has given me a distorted view of the world, but my view of the world has been in general, Positive.  I believe people's intentions are in general.. Good. This positive outlook is the source of my confusion.  
  
  I realize there is suffering in the world. This year has made it abundantly clear.  More people are dying in one day of a pandemic than all the people that died on 9/11. Leaders all over the world, the smartest people in the world, can't come together with a cohesive message to try and deter it, or at the very least console the people who are suffering most from it.  There are wars, terrorism, suppression, you name it.  Everything outside of my immediate world, sounds and looks pretty bleak.  
  
  Yet when I look around me, when there is suffering, I see a community build and fight against it. When there is suppression, I see a bigger crowd and strong people speak out and get rid of it.  When I experience a pandemic, I see a rally to create the fastest ever vaccine to be approved.  This clash of my experience vs what I read about and learn about outside of it, is the confusion I feel.  
  
  When I think about learning, I try and learn by taking advice from books, teachers, lessons, etc. and build my own thoughts and actions from the hands on experience I have from the sources.  Have my sources been so one sided that my experience is blind to the anger and hatred that people seem to be building? Should I be feeling angry about the state of the world today? Or should I be feeling hopeful, like I do? 
  
  I have to trust my experience I think.  It's the best way I know how to figure it all out. 
  
## Walking my Little Sky (started on 10-27-2020)

  She's still little to me.  Although everyone has told me how much she has grown. Sky, my ray of sunshine.. my little pup.  I'm convinced that she'll forever stay little to me.  I have walked her every day since I got her.  Only now have a really thought about the experience itself though.  Life is funny. Walking a dog may be one of the more relatable tasks among people who are lucky enough to own one of their own.  So relatable that it's not even worth talking about. Yet today, for some reason I came to the realization of how walking with my Sky can say so much about the rest of my life.
  
  It's been several months since I first locked eyes with her.  I remember the first day, immediately becoming so attached to another living thing. I was terrified that she was never going to love me. Never going to get along with anyone or anything else. Never going to walk by my side.  I was in awe of the tasks that lay ahead of me, and at the same time eager to get started. 
  
  The first day of walking went terribly.  Yet I took so much care in every detail about the situation.  She had the harness on, perfectly fit. Poop bags ready, treats in hand, water (just in case she gets thirsty). We never made it past the first block.  Day by day though, sure enough, we got a few feet further each time.  I know because I measured it. 
  
  Fast forward to present day. We have the "hang of it".  At best. We got to a point where she is at a socially acceptable level of walking.  Some might even say she is exceptional, just because she doesn't bark at other dogs when we walk by.  Instead of working with her to figure out an optimal walking pace, I get frustrated and pull, and she will pull back. The funkier the smell, the stronger she'll pull, and the stronger I will pull back.  I actually grade how she walks each day based on how good she is at reading my mind for that particular walk on the direction in which I want to go. Needless to say.. she hasn't gotten a great grade in a while.  But it's okay.. because hey, the neighbor was delighted to see that she didn't bark while they walked by. Good job Sky.
  
  What I realize is that this simple act of walking with Sky every day, actually reflects my interactions in life.  At first, whether it's a new task, or a new relationship (work, life, family), at first my discipline and growth curve is solid. I won't go as far as perfect.. but pretty solid. When these ideas mature, and get to a point of "socially above average".. things really slow down.  Maybe even degrade. And time just goes on. 
  
  I saw that today. Sky and I haven't improved in a while.  People still think we are good walking together.. but how much value is that really? I want to walk further each day with Sky. Maybe even run with her.  I want us both to be incentivized to go in the same directions. Not because she might choke on her harness if she doesn't listen.. but because we both really want to. Heck, I want to have the most enjoyable and impressive walks with Sky than anyone in the world!
  
  Yet the next day comes. I forget the treats at home.  The neighbor compliments Skylar again. And Skylar still can't read my mind... and a few months go by.
